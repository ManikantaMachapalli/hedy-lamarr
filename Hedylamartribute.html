<div class="about">
    <p>Lamarr was born Hedwig Eva Maria Kiesler in 1914 in Vienna, the only child of Gertrud 
        "Trude" Kiesler</p>
    <p>Her father, Emil, was born to a Galician-Jewish family in Lemberg in the Austrian</p>
    <p>part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire (now Lviv in Ukraine) and was, in the 1920s, deputy director of Wiener</p>
    <p>Bankverein,[8][9] and in the end of his life a director at the united Creditanstalt-Bankverein.</p>
    <p>Trude, her mother, a pianist and Budapest native, had come from an upper-class Hungarian-Jewish family.</p>
    <p>She had converted to Catholicism and was described as a "practicing Christian" who raised her daughter as a Christian,</p>
    <p>although Hedy was not formally baptized at the time.[10]: 8 </p>
    <p>As a child, Lamarr showed an interest in acting and was fascinated by theatre and film.</p>
    <p>At the age of 12, she won a beauty contest in Vienna.[13] She also began to associate invention with her father,</p>
    <p>who would take her out on walks, explaining how technology functioned.[14][15]</p>
